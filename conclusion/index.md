# Conclusion

This guide covered only the tip of the iceberg. There is far more syntax and tricks to be learned as you evolve as a bash user. Bash scripting, and its associated Linux constructs, unlock a huge world of opportunities and applications. Bash scripting is also widely used, especially on servers, making it a great skill for system administrators to have.

```warning
More comprehensive resources for furthering your knowledge of bash scripting include:
- [ ] The [Bash Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) (also via [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/bash/)) and [The Linux Documentation Project](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/), both of which were referenced many times in this guide
- [ ] The bash cheatsheets from [DevHints](https://devhints.io/bash) and [Lehigh University](http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/course/2013/cunix/handouts/bash.quickref.pdf) serve as excellent quick reference materials for basic syntax
- [ ] If you are more of a book person, the [Bash Cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/bash-cookbook-2nd/9781491975329/) is an excellent resource for finding snippets of code that you can adapt to solve virtually any problem
- [ ] [StackOverflow](https://unix.stackexchange.com/), as with many computer science topics, serves as a great Q&A forum to ask questions about the various intricacies of bash scripting

As with any programming language, practice makes perfect. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/bash-script-code-challenges-for-beginners/) has a great list of projects to work on to build your skills. We recommend the __Detect Mounted Disks, Listing and Sorting Directories, and Sales Tax Calculator projects__ for those who have completed this guide.

If you feel like you need some more practice with the basics before moving onto a full-sized project, [Tecmint](https://www.tecmint.com/basic-shell-programming-part-ii/) has a list of beginner-level mini-projects complete with sample solutions in case you get stuck. __But of course, the best project is the one that youâ€™re most motivated to accomplish, regardless of the difficulty__. 

#### Armed with this guide and other internet resources, you can build anything that you put your mind to!
